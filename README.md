# License Plate Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project implements a U-Net architecture using TensorFlow for segmenting license plates in vehicle images. It includes a deployed Streamlit app for easy interaction and demonstration of the model's capabilities.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the [Car License Plate Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection) dataset available on Kaggle.

## Features
- U-Net based segmentation model.
- Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics (IoU, Dice coefficient).
- Streamlit app for model demonstration: [License Plate Segmentation App](https://licenseplatesegmentation.streamlit.app/)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsoltgeier/LicensePlateSegmentation.git
```
Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
